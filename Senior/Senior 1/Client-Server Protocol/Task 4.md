# Task 4

Task:

Your task is to create a custom video player that supports streaming live video
from a remote server. You will need to use the AVFoundation framework and build
a custom UI for the video player. The video should play smoothly and without
buffering, even on slower network connections. You will also need to implement a
way for users to pause, resume, and seek the video.

Solution:

To accomplish this task, you can start by creating a custom UIView that will
serve as the container for the video player. Then, you can use the AVPlayer and
AVPlayerLayer classes to load and play the video content. To handle the
buffering and playback smoothness, you can use AVPlayer's built-in adaptive
bitrate streaming capabilities.

For the custom UI, you can create controls such as play/pause, seek, and volume
controls, and wire them up to the appropriate AVPlayer methods. You can also
implement features such as playback speed control and playback rate adjustment.

To support streaming live video, you can use the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)
protocol, which is supported by AVFoundation. This will allow you to stream
video content from a remote server and adapt to network conditions in real-time.

Overall, the key difference between this task and the previous ones is the
complexity and scope of the project. Building a custom video player with
advanced features such as adaptive streaming, custom UI controls, and support
for live video requires a higher level of expertise and experience than the
previous tasks. Additionally, the task requires a deep understanding of the
AVFoundation framework and video streaming protocols, as well as experience with
building custom UIs for media playback.
