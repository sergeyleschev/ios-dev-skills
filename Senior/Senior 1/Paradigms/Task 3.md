# Task 3

Task:

You're building a social networking app that allows users to create and join
groups based on shared interests. The app needs to support real-time chat
functionality within groups.

Design and implement the chat functionality for the app, keeping in mind that it
needs to be scalable and efficient. Use any relevant knowledge or experience
from other platforms and paradigms to inform your solution.

Solution:

For the chat functionality, I would use Firebase's Realtime Database, which
provides a scalable and efficient way to store and sync data in real time.
Firebase also has a great Swift SDK that can be used with UIKit.

To implement the chat functionality, I would create a new chat group in the
database for each group in the app, and each message sent in the group would be
stored as a child node within the group. I would then use Firebase's real-time
event listeners to receive new messages as they are added to the group, and
update the UI accordingly.

In addition, to ensure that the chat feature is efficient and scalable, I would
implement pagination and lazy loading for the messages. This would allow the app
to only load a certain number of messages at a time, reducing the load on the
network and making the chat feature faster and more responsive.

To further enhance the performance and scalability of the chat feature, I would
also consider implementing server-side message processing, such as filtering or
sentiment analysis, to offload some of the processing from the client side.
