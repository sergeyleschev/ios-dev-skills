# Task 3

Task: You are working on an iOS app that displays a list of images. The images
are loaded from a server and displayed in a collection view. However, you notice
that the app is becoming slow and unresponsive when scrolling through the
collection view. You suspect that this might be due to memory leaks.

Your task is to identify and fix any memory leaks that might be causing this
issue. You can use any techniques or tools available in Swift and Foundation to
accomplish this.

Solution: To avoid memory leaks, we need to ensure that all objects are being
properly deallocated when they are no longer needed. In this case, we can start
by checking if there are any strong reference cycles in the code. One common
source of strong reference cycles is closures that capture self.

We can use the Instruments tool to identify any memory leaks in the app.
Specifically, we can use the Allocations and Leaks instruments to track memory
usage and detect any memory leaks.

Once we have identified any memory leaks, we can then address them by breaking
any strong reference cycles and ensuring that objects are properly deallocated.
For example, we can use weak or unowned references in closures that capture self
to avoid strong reference cycles. We can also use ARC (Automatic Reference
Counting) to automatically manage object memory and deallocate objects when they
are no longer needed.

In addition, we can also optimize image loading by using techniques such as lazy
loading, caching, and image resizing to reduce memory usage and improve app
performance.

As a senior level developer, you should be able to quickly identify and resolve
memory leaks in complex applications, and have a deep understanding of how to
optimize memory usage and improve app performance.
