# Task 1

Task:

You are working on a large-scale iOS app and you notice that certain views are
taking a long time to load. After some investigation, you realize that there are
several memory leaks in your code. Your task is to identify the causes of the
leaks and fix them.

Solution:

To identify the causes of the memory leaks, you can use Xcode's Instruments
tool. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Open Xcode and select "Product" from the menu bar.
2. Select "Profile" and choose the "Leaks" template from the list.
3. Run your app on the simulator or a connected device.
4. Instruments will start tracking memory allocations and will show you any
   memory leaks in real-time.
5. Navigate to the screen or view that is taking a long time to load and perform
   the actions that trigger the memory leaks.
6. Observe the Instruments tool for any memory leaks that occur.

Once you have identified the sources of the memory leaks, you can fix them by:

1. Identifying any strong reference cycles between objects and breaking them
   using weak or unowned references.
2. Ensuring that objects are being deallocated properly by removing any
   unnecessary strong references to them.
3. Reducing the overall memory footprint of your app by reusing objects and
   reducing the number of unnecessary allocations.

By fixing the memory leaks in your app, you will not only improve its
performance but also ensure that it is more stable and less likely to crash due
to memory issues.

To differentiate a senior-level developer from a middle-level developer, the
interviewer should pay attention to the following:

1. Ability to identify memory leaks in complex and large-scale codebases.
2. Understanding of how to use Xcode Instruments to identify and analyze memory
   leaks.
3. Knowledge of how to fix memory leaks using various techniques such as weak
   and unowned references, proper deallocation, and memory optimization.
4. Ability to identify and optimize memory usage in the app to improve overall
   performance and stability.
5. Strong problem-solving and debugging skills to quickly identify and fix
   memory-related issues.
