# Task 2

Task: You are a senior iOS developer and your team has been having communication
issues lately. Your task is to propose a set of team behaviour standards that
will help improve communication, productivity and team morale. Your proposed
standards should be realistic and achievable, and should not be based on
fanatical ideas.

Solution: As a senior iOS developer, I believe that establishing team behaviour
standards is critical for improving communication, productivity, and team
morale. Here are some non-fanatical ideas that I would propose:

1. Encourage open and honest communication: Team members should be encouraged to
   express their opinions and ideas freely without fear of retaliation. Open and
   honest communication is critical for improving productivity and building
   trust within the team.
2. Respectful and inclusive behaviour: Everyone should be treated with respect
   and inclusivity, regardless of their role, gender, race or religion. Creating
   an inclusive environment where everyone feels valued and respected will
   improve morale and productivity.
3. Active listening: Active listening is an important communication skill that
   can improve understanding, avoid misunderstandings and build trust within the
   team. Team members should listen actively to each other and avoid
   interrupting or dismissing other team members' ideas.
4. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities: Each team member should have
   clearly defined roles and responsibilities to avoid confusion and conflicts.
   Everyone should be aware of their own roles and responsibilities as well as
   those of other team members.
5. Regular feedback and evaluation: Regular feedback and evaluation can help
   identify and address issues early on, as well as provide opportunities for
   growth and improvement. It's important to give and receive feedback
   constructively, with a focus on improvement rather than criticism.

By implementing these team behaviour standards, we can improve communication,
productivity and team morale, which will ultimately benefit the entire team and
the project.
