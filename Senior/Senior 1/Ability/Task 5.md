# Task 5

Task: You've been tasked with improving the performance of an existing app. The
app is experiencing long load times and sluggish performance on older devices.

Write a brief plan outlining the steps you would take to identify and address
the performance issues, as well as any potential challenges you may face.

Solution: To improve the app's performance, I would follow these steps:

1. Conduct a performance analysis using profiling tools such as Instruments to
   identify any bottlenecks in the app's code.
2. Identify any inefficient or redundant code, such as excessive memory
   allocation, and optimize it for better performance.
3. Consider implementing caching mechanisms or lazy loading to reduce load times
   and improve overall performance.
4. Test the app on a range of devices, including older devices, to ensure
   optimal performance across the board.
5. Consider leveraging any available system-level optimizations, such as Grand
   Central Dispatch or Metal, to further improve performance.

Challenges that may arise include:

-   Ensuring that performance improvements don't negatively impact the app's
    functionality or user experience.
-   Balancing performance improvements with other development priorities or
    timelines.
-   Working within the constraints of any existing architecture or codebase.

Differences between Senior 1 and Middle 3 may include:

-   A more holistic understanding of the app's performance, including both
    high-level and low-level optimizations.
-   The ability to identify and address performance issues in complex codebases.
-   The ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with team members and
    stakeholders to ensure that performance improvements align with overall
    development goals.
