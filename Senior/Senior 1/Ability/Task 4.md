# Task 4

Task: As a senior iOS developer, you have been tasked with improving the
performance of a slow-loading screen in an app that you are working on. The
screen contains a large amount of data and images that are currently being
loaded synchronously. Your goal is to improve the performance of the screen and
ensure that the data and images are loaded asynchronously.

Solution: To improve the performance of the screen and ensure that the data and
images are loaded asynchronously, I would take the following steps:

1. Identify the root cause of the slow-loading screen. This could involve using
   Xcode's profiling tools to pinpoint any bottlenecks in the code.
2. Once I have identified the root cause of the issue, I would start by
   implementing lazy loading for any images or data that are being loaded
   synchronously. This would involve using asynchronous techniques such as
   Dispatch Queues or Operations to load data in the background.
3. I would also consider implementing pagination or infinite scrolling for any
   large sets of data to prevent the entire dataset from being loaded at once,
   which could contribute to slow loading times.
4. I would also make sure to implement appropriate caching mechanisms to ensure
   that data and images are not loaded unnecessarily, which could further
   improve performance.
5. Finally, I would thoroughly test the changes to ensure that the performance
   of the screen has been improved and that data and images are being loaded
   asynchronously.

Differences that indicate development from Middle 3 to Senior 1:

-   The Senior 1 developer is expected to have a deeper understanding of
    performance optimization techniques and be able to use profiling tools to
    identify the root cause of performance issues.
-   The Senior 1 developer is expected to be able to implement more advanced
    techniques such as lazy loading and pagination to improve performance, while
    also ensuring that appropriate caching mechanisms are in place.
-   The Senior 1 developer is expected to be able to thoroughly test the changes
    to ensure that they are effective, rather than relying solely on code
    reviews or basic testing methods.
