# Task 2

Task: Write a method that takes a view and a closure as arguments. The closure
should perform layout and diff calculations for the view's subviews on a
non-main thread, and then apply the changes on the main thread.

Solution:

```swift
func layoutSubviewsOnBackgroundThread(_ view: UIView, closure: @escaping () -> Void) {
    DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
        closure()
        DispatchQueue.main.async {
            view.layoutIfNeeded()
        }
    }
}
```

Differences from Middle 3 to Senior 1:

-   The ability to work with complex autolayout code and optimization techniques
    to improve performance.
-   Experience with multithreaded programming and handling concurrency.
-   The ability to write concise and readable code that solves complex problems
    efficiently.
