# Task 1

Task: You are given a complex view hierarchy with multiple subviews and
autolayout constraints. Your task is to optimize the layout and diff calculation
process by moving it to a non-main thread to improve performance.

Solution: To optimize the layout and diff calculation process, we can take
advantage of the fact that UIKit is thread-safe and move these operations to a
background thread. This will allow the main thread to remain free and responsive
to user interactions.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. Create a new DispatchQueue for background processing:

```swift
let backgroundQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.example.layoutQueue", qos: .userInitiated)
```

2. Move the layout and diff calculation code to the background queue:

```swift
backgroundQueue.async {
    // perform layout and diff calculation here
}
```

3. Once the layout and diff calculation is complete, update the UI on the main
   thread:

```swift
DispatchQueue.main.async {
    // update UI here
}
```

By following these steps, we can ensure that the layout and diff calculation
process is moved to a non-main thread and the main thread remains free to handle
user interactions. This will improve the overall performance of the app.

Differences from Middle 3: At the Senior 1 level, the developer is expected to
have a strong understanding of concurrency and performance optimization
techniques. They should be able to identify performance bottlenecks and take
steps to optimize them. Moving layout and diff calculation to a non-main thread
is an example of such an optimization. The developer should also be familiar
with Grand Central Dispatch and be able to use it effectively.
