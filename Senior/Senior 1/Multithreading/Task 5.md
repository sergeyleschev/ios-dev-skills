# Task 5

Task: Write a method that fetches data from a remote API using URLSession and
performs a long-running data processing task on a background thread. Once the
processing is complete, the results should be returned on the main thread for
display.

Solution:

```swift
func fetchDataFromRemoteAPI() {
    // Set up URL request
    guard let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/data") else {
        print("Invalid URL")
        return
    }
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "GET"

    // Create URLSession data task
    let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
        guard let data = data else {
            print("Error fetching data: \(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")")
            return
        }

        // Perform long-running data processing task on a background thread
        DispatchQueue.global().async {
            let processedData = processData(data)

            // Return results on the main thread
            DispatchQueue.main.async {
                displayResults(processedData)
            }
        }
    }

    task.resume()
}

func processData(_ data: Data) -> ProcessedData {
    // Perform data processing task
    // This could include parsing JSON, decoding images, or any other long-running task
    // Return processed data
}

func displayResults(_ processedData: ProcessedData) {
    // Update UI with results
}
```

Differences that indicate a Senior level developer:

-   Understanding of best practices for handling asynchronous tasks in a
    production environment, including error handling and performance
    considerations
-   Ability to write efficient, high-performance code that avoids unnecessary
    blocking or thread contention
-   Familiarity with advanced concurrency concepts such as dispatch groups,
    semaphores, and barriers, and the ability to apply them to complex problems.
