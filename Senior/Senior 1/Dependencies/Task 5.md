# Task 5

Task: You have been given a task to refactor an existing codebase that has tight
coupling between multiple components. Describe how you would approach this task
and what steps you would take to implement dependency injection to improve the
maintainability and testability of the codebase.

Answer: To refactor the existing codebase, I would first identify the components
that have tight coupling and analyze the dependencies between them. I would then
create interfaces for these components and use dependency injection to inject
the dependencies at runtime. This would decouple the components and make them
more modular and testable.

To implement dependency injection, I would use a dependency injection framework
such as Swinject or Typhoon. I would then define my dependencies in a container,
configure the dependencies, and inject them into the components as needed.

In addition to implementing dependency injection, a Senior 1 iOS developer
should also be able to identify and refactor areas of code that are overly
complex or difficult to maintain. They should have a strong understanding of
software architecture principles and be able to apply them to improve the
overall design of the codebase. Additionally, a Senior 1 iOS developer should be
able to work with other developers and provide mentorship and guidance to more
junior team members.
