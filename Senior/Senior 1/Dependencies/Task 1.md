# Task 1

Task: Explain the concept of modularization in iOS app development and how it
can be achieved. Give an example of a module that could be extracted from a
typical app.

Solution: Modularization is the process of breaking down an app into smaller,
more manageable modules, or units of code. This makes the app easier to maintain
and extend over time.

Modularization can be achieved in several ways, including by separating the app
into multiple frameworks or modules. This allows for better organization of the
codebase, as well as easier reuse of code across different parts of the app.

For example, a typical app might have a module dedicated to user authentication.
This module could contain all the code related to user login and sign up, as
well as account management functionality. By separating this module into its own
framework, it could be reused across different parts of the app or even in
different apps altogether.

Overall, modularization can help to make app development more scalable and
maintainable, particularly as apps become more complex over time.
