# Task 2

Task:

You are developing a new feature for an existing iOS app that relies heavily on
third-party libraries. The app is currently using Carthage for dependency
management, but your team is considering switching to CocoaPods. Your task is to
evaluate the pros and cons of both Carthage and CocoaPods and present your
recommendation to your team.

Solution:

Both Carthage and CocoaPods are popular dependency management tools for iOS
apps, but they have some differences that should be taken into account.

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds frameworks, and it
doesn't require any configuration files or dependencies to manage. It's easy to
integrate with Xcode, but it requires more manual work to set up the
dependencies. One downside of Carthage is that it doesn't handle transitive
dependencies, which can lead to conflicts between different dependencies.

CocoaPods is a centralized dependency manager that downloads and installs the
dependencies using a configuration file. It's easy to use and configure, but it
requires some extra steps to integrate with Xcode. One of the advantages of
CocoaPods is that it can handle transitive dependencies automatically. However,
CocoaPods has a slower build time because it compiles the dependencies into the
main project.

Based on these considerations, my recommendation is to stick with Carthage for
the following reasons:

-   Carthage is more lightweight and less intrusive than CocoaPods, which is
    beneficial for the app's performance and stability.
-   Carthage's decentralized approach allows for more flexibility in managing
    dependencies, which can be useful when working with a complex project that
    requires specific libraries.
-   Carthage's lack of automatic handling of transitive dependencies can be seen
    as a disadvantage, but it's also an opportunity to manually manage
    dependencies, which can lead to a more optimized project.

Overall, Carthage and CocoaPods have their pros and cons, and the choice depends
on the specific needs of the project. In this case, I believe that Carthage is
the best choice for our app.
