# Task 4

Task: As a senior developer, you will be responsible for ensuring that your team
is following best practices for code integration using Git. One important part
of this is resolving merge conflicts. Imagine that you are working on a project
with a team member and have both made changes to the same file. Your changes are
on lines 1-10, and your team member's changes are on lines 15-20. There is a
conflict on line 15 that needs to be resolved. Write a command or series of
commands that you would use to resolve this conflict in Git.

Solution: To resolve this conflict, I would use the following series of
commands:

1. First, I would navigate to the directory containing the project in the
   terminal:

```bash
cd path/to/project/directory
```

2. Then, I would pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin branch-name
```

3. Git will notify us of the merge conflict and mark the conflicted files with
   **`<<<<<<< HEAD`** and **`>>>>>>> branch-name`** markers, where HEAD
   represents the changes on our local branch and branch-name represents the
   changes on the remote branch.
4. We can then use a text editor to manually resolve the conflict by editing the
   file to remove the markers and choose which changes to keep.
5. Once we have resolved the conflict, we can stage the changes:

```bash
git add path/to/file
```

6. Finally, we can commit the changes with a message describing the resolution:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict on path/to/file"
```

7. Finally, we push the changes to the remote branch:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

One important difference between this task and the previous tasks for Middle
developers is that this task requires the developer to be comfortable with
resolving merge conflicts in Git, which is a more advanced Git skill. The
solution to this task also includes multiple Git commands and a manual
resolution step, which requires more experience and expertise with Git than the
previous tasks. Additionally, the task requires a greater understanding of
collaboration and best practices in working with a team using Git.
