# Task 5

Task: As part of a project, you have been tasked with implementing a CI/CD
process for your iOS app. The app is built using Swift and UIKit. Write a brief
outline of the steps you would take to build the CI/CD pipeline and automate
common chores.

Solution:

1. Start by setting up a version control system such as Git to track changes to
   the codebase.
2. Use a continuous integration service like Jenkins or Travis CI to build and
   test the app every time new code is pushed to the repository.
3. Write automated tests to ensure that the app behaves as expected and does not
   have any bugs or errors.
4. Use a build tool like Fastlane to automate the build and deployment process.
5. Integrate the build tool with the continuous integration service to
   automatically build and deploy the app to a test environment.
6. Once the app is tested and approved in the test environment, use the build
   tool to deploy it to production.
7. Finally, monitor the app's performance in production and continue to make
   improvements to the CI/CD process as needed.

As a Senior 1 iOS developer, the key differences in their approach to building a
CI/CD process and automating common chores will be:

-   A Senior 1 developer will have a deeper understanding of the technologies
    involved in building a CI/CD pipeline and will be able to identify and
    resolve issues quickly.
-   They will have experience in designing and implementing scalable and
    efficient automation processes that can handle the complexities of
    large-scale iOS projects.
-   They will have a strong understanding of best practices for testing and
    deployment, as well as experience in troubleshooting issues that arise
    during the process.
