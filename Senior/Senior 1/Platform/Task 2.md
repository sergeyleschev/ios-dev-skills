# Task 2

Task: You are building a new feature for a messaging app that will allow users
to send and receive voice messages. As a senior iOS developer, you are expected
to bring in value from other platforms and paradigms to improve the user
experience.

Provide a brief outline of how you would approach this feature and what tools or
paradigms you might use to enhance the user experience.

Solution: To build this feature, I would start by researching best practices for
implementing voice messaging in other messaging apps, such as WhatsApp or
Telegram. I would also explore other platforms such as Android and see how they
have implemented voice messaging in their apps.

To provide an intuitive user experience, I would consider using speech
recognition technology to enable users to transcribe voice messages into text.
This feature would make it easier for users to read voice messages in situations
where they cannot listen to the message, such as in a noisy environment.

I would also incorporate reactive programming principles to ensure that the app
is responsive and reactive to user input. This would involve using tools such as
RxSwift or Combine to handle asynchronous events and ensure that the app's UI is
always up to date.

In addition, I would prioritize accessibility features such as closed captioning
and voiceover support to ensure that the feature is usable by all users,
regardless of their abilities. Finally, I would perform extensive testing to
ensure that the feature is reliable, fast, and easy to use.
