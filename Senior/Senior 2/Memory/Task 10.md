# Task 10

Task: Write a function that can efficiently process large amounts of data
without causing memory issues.

Solution:

To efficiently process large amounts of data, we can use an approach called
chunking. This involves breaking up the data into smaller chunks, processing
each chunk one at a time, and then combining the results at the end.

Here's an example function that uses chunking to process a large array of
numbers:

```swift
func processLargeData(data: [Int], chunkSize: Int) -> Int {
    var result = 0

    // Chunk the data into smaller arrays
    let chunks = stride(from: 0, to: data.count, by: chunkSize).map {
        Array(data[$0..<min($0 + chunkSize, data.count)])
    }

    // Process each chunk
    for chunk in chunks {
        // Do some processing on the chunk
        let chunkResult = chunk.reduce(0, +)

        // Combine the chunk results
        result += chunkResult
    }

    return result
}
```

This function takes in an array of integers and a chunk size, and returns the
sum of all the integers in the array. It first chunks the data into smaller
arrays using the **`stride`** function, and then loops over each chunk to do
some processing on it. In this case, the processing is just summing up all the
integers in the chunk using the **`reduce`** function. Finally, it combines the
results of each chunk by adding them together.

One key difference between a senior level 1 and senior level 2 developer in this
context would be the ability to optimize the chunk size based on the available
memory and device constraints, as well as the ability to handle edge cases such
as when the data size is very small or very large.
