# Task 2

Task: You are working on a team project and have been tasked with implementing a
new feature. You have completed the feature and made several commits to your
local branch. However, your team lead has informed you that there are conflicts
with the main branch and asked you to resolve them before merging your code.
Please merge your changes with the main branch and resolve any conflicts.

Solution:

1. First, switch to the main branch and pull the latest changes:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
```

2. Then, switch back to your local branch and merge the changes from the main
   branch:

```bash
git checkout [your-branch]
git merge main
```

3. If there are conflicts, resolve them manually by opening the conflicted
   files, reviewing the changes, and selecting the appropriate code. Once you
   have resolved all conflicts, save and close the files.
4. Add the conflicted files to the staging area and commit the changes:

```bash
git add [conflicted-files]
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts with main branch"
```

5. Finally, push your changes to the remote branch:

```bash
git push
```
