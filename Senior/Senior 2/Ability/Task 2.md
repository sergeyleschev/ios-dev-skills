# Task 2

Task: You are given a task to optimize the performance of an existing iOS app.
The app currently experiences slow loading times and stuttering animations.
Provide a brief analysis of the possible causes and suggest some solutions to
improve the app's performance.

Solution: Possible causes of slow loading times and stuttering animations could
be due to inefficient memory usage, unoptimized code, or overuse of heavy
animations and graphics. To improve the app's performance, some solutions could
be to:

-   Optimize code by removing unnecessary loops, reducing excessive function
    calls, and minimizing I/O operations.
-   Implement lazy loading to load only the necessary data on demand and improve
    memory usage.
-   Use lighter animations and graphics and reduce their frequency to minimize
    the impact on performance.
-   Implement caching to reduce network calls and improve loading times.
-   Use Instruments to identify bottlenecks in the app and optimize the relevant
    code.

Differences from Senior 1: The difference between Senior 1 and Senior 2 is that
the latter should have more experience in performance optimization and be able
to suggest more advanced techniques such as using memory profilers, analyzing
CPU and GPU usage, and implementing multithreading to improve performance.
Senior 2 should also have a better understanding of the app's architecture and
be able to identify potential performance issues early on in the development
process.
