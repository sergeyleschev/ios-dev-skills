# Task 1

Task: You are a senior iOS developer and have been tasked with leading a team of
junior developers on a new project. One of the key responsibilities in this role
is to establish team behavior standards that promote a positive and productive
work environment. Write a brief plan outlining your approach to establishing
these standards.

Solution:

1. Hold a team meeting to discuss the importance of team behavior standards and
   the impact they have on the project and team morale.
2. Collaborate with the team to develop a list of behaviors that are important
   for the team to follow, such as respect for each other's opinions,
   willingness to learn and help others, and open communication.
3. Establish consequences for behavior that does not meet the established
   standards. These consequences should be clearly communicated and enforced
   consistently.
4. Encourage feedback from team members on how the established standards are
   working and make adjustments as necessary.
5. Lead by example and model the behavior you expect from team members.

Differences that indicate development from Senior 1 to Senior 2:

-   In Senior 2, the developer is expected to not only establish team behavior
    standards, but also to ensure they are adhered to and maintained over time.
-   The Senior 2 developer should have the ability to address any issues with
    team behavior standards in a constructive and proactive manner, rather than
    reactive.
-   The Senior 2 developer should also be able to identify and address any
    underlying issues that may be impacting team behavior, such as lack of
    motivation or ineffective communication. ÃŸ
