Task: Implement a feature in an existing iOS project that requires interacting
with a complex external API. Use a modular architecture pattern like VIPER or
Clean Architecture to ensure that the new feature is testable and maintainable.
Explain the benefits of using a modular architecture pattern.

Differences indicating development to Senior 2 level:

-   Able to identify and select the appropriate modular architecture pattern for
    the specific requirements of the project
-   Demonstrates a deep understanding of how modular architecture patterns can
    be used to improve code quality, maintainability, and testability
-   Can effectively communicate the benefits of using a modular architecture
    pattern to other team members and stakeholders, including trade-offs made
    and potential risks.
