# Task 5

Task: You are working on an iOS app that displays a list of items. You notice
that the app is becoming slow and unresponsive as the user scrolls through the
list, and suspect that there may be a memory leak. Identify the potential source
of the memory leak and provide a solution to fix it.

Solution: One potential source of the memory leak in this scenario could be
related to the reuse of cells in a UITableView. If the cells are not properly
dequeued and reused, they can accumulate in memory and cause performance issues.

To fix this, ensure that cells are dequeued and reused properly using the
**`dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier:for:)`** method in **`UITableView`**.
Also, make sure to properly release any resources or objects held by the cell in
the **`prepareForReuse()`** method of the **`UITableViewCell`** subclass.

To go a step further, consider using Instruments to identify any other potential
sources of memory leaks in the app, and use techniques such as weak references
or unowned references to prevent retain cycles and avoid memory leaks.
Additionally, implement the use of autoreleasepools to manage memory allocation
and deallocation effectively.

Differences from Senior 1 level: A Senior 2 level developer would be able to
identify and diagnose memory leaks more effectively, using more advanced
debugging techniques such as Instruments. They would also have a deeper
understanding of memory management concepts such as retain cycles, weak and
unowned references, and autoreleasepools. Finally, they would have the ability
to implement more complex memory management strategies to optimize the
performance and efficiency of the app.
