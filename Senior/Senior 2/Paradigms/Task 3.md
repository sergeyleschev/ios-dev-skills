# Task 3

Task:

As a Senior iOS Developer, you have been tasked with building a new feature for
an existing app that integrates with an external API. The API returns data in a
format that is not easily usable in the app. You need to design and implement a
solution to parse and transform the data into a usable format for the app.

Requirements:

-   Use URLSession to make the API request.
-   Use Codable to parse the API response data.
-   Implement a model class or struct to represent the transformed data.
-   Use functional programming principles, such as map and filter, to transform
    the data.
-   Handle any errors that may occur during the API request or data
    transformation.
-   Write unit tests to ensure the solution works as expected.

Time Limit: 15 minutes.

Difference from previous level (Senior 1): This task is designed to be more
complex than the previous tasks for Senior 1, as it requires integrating with an
external API and transforming the data into a usable format. The use of
functional programming principles, such as map and filter, is also expected at
this level. Additionally, the requirement for writing unit tests is new and
reflects the expectation that Senior 2 developers are able to ensure the quality
of their code through testing.
