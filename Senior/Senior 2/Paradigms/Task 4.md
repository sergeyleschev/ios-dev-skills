# Task 4

Task: Develop a custom UIKit component that implements a search bar with live
filtering functionality. The component should support a data source of strings,
and as the user types in the search bar, the data source should be filtered in
real-time based on the current search query. The component should also support a
delegate protocol that allows the parent view controller to be notified when the
user selects an item from the filtered list. The component should be designed to
be reusable across multiple screens and view controllers.

Differences from Senior 1: In addition to implementing custom UI components, a
Senior 2 iOS Developer should be able to architect and design reusable
components that can be used across multiple screens and view controllers. They
should also have a strong understanding of delegation and be able to implement
delegate protocols for custom components.
