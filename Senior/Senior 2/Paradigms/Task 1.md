# Task 1

Task: Implement a feature that integrates with a backend service that uses
GraphQL as its API. The feature should allow the user to search for products by
name, category, or any other relevant parameter. Use ApolloClient for GraphQL
queries.

Differences from Senior 1 level:

1. Integration with a new backend service that uses GraphQL instead of a
   familiar RESTful API.
2. Usage of ApolloClient for executing GraphQL queries instead of the
   conventional URLSession.
3. Ability to efficiently write GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch data from
   the server.
4. Strong understanding of the GraphQL schema and how it relates to the data
   models used in the app.
