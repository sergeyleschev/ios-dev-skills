# Task 5

Task: Implement a video chat feature that can handle multiple participants and
includes the ability to share screens.

Solution: To implement a video chat feature that can handle multiple
participants and screen sharing, we can use a server-client architecture. The
server can manage the signaling process between the clients, while the clients
can use a peer-to-peer protocol to transmit data between each other.

For example, we can use WebRTC as the peer-to-peer protocol and create a
signaling server using Node.js and WebSocket. On the client-side, we can use
Swift and the WebRTC framework to establish a peer-to-peer connection and
transmit video and audio data.

To handle multiple participants, we can create a room system where clients can
join a specific room and communicate with each other. To enable screen sharing,
we can use the screen sharing API provided by iOS and transmit the screen data
through the peer-to-peer connection.

The main difference between a Senior 1 and a Senior 2 developer in this task
would be the ability to design and implement a more scalable and efficient
server-client architecture that can handle a large number of clients and
minimize latency. The Senior 2 developer would also have the ability to optimize
the video and audio data transmission for different network conditions and
devices, as well as implement advanced features such as recording, playback, and
filters.
