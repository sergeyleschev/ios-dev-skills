# Task 3

Task: Implement a custom video codec that compresses the video stream and sends
it over the network. Use the H.264 video compression standard for this task.

Solution: To implement a custom video codec, we need to first understand how
video compression works. Video compression algorithms use techniques like motion
estimation, motion compensation, and spatial and temporal redundancy to reduce
the amount of data required to represent a video frame. H.264 is a popular video
compression standard that is widely used in video conferencing and other
applications.

To implement a custom video codec using H.264, we can use the VideoToolbox
framework provided by Apple. This framework provides APIs for encoding and
decoding video data using various compression standards, including H.264. Here's
an outline of the steps involved:

1. Create a video compression session using the VideoToolbox framework.
2. Set the session properties, including the video resolution, frame rate, and
   compression parameters.
3. Start the compression session.
4. For each video frame, encode the video data using the compression session.
5. Send the compressed video data over the network.
6. On the receiving end, decode the compressed video data using the VideoToolbox
   framework.

The main difference between a senior 1 and a senior 2 developer in this task is
the ability to optimize the compression algorithm for better performance and
efficiency. A senior 2 developer should be able to analyze the performance of
the video codec and identify opportunities for optimization, such as adjusting
the compression parameters or using hardware acceleration to improve the
encoding and decoding speed. Additionally, a senior 2 developer should be able
to handle more complex scenarios, such as network congestion, packet loss, and
jitter, and implement error correction and mitigation techniques to ensure the
video quality is not affected.
