# Task 1

Task:

You are working on a new iOS app and you have been asked to design a test
pyramid for the app's testing strategy. The app is a social media platform with
features like user authentication, posting and commenting, messaging, and
profile management. Your task is to design a test pyramid that covers all the
necessary areas of the app while ensuring maintainability and non-overlapping
coverage.

Solution:

At the senior 2 level, an iOS developer should be able to design a test pyramid
that not only provides comprehensive test coverage but also ensures
maintainability and non-overlapping coverage. Here's an example test pyramid for
the social media app:

Top of the pyramid: End-to-end tests

-   Automate end-to-end tests using XCTest and XCUITest frameworks to ensure all
    parts of the app work together as expected. These tests should cover
    critical user flows such as user registration, login, posting and
    commenting, messaging, and profile management.

Middle of the pyramid: Integration tests

-   Automate integration tests for each major feature of the app using XCTest
    framework. These tests should test the interaction of different components
    or modules within the app and ensure that the app is functioning properly.

Bottom of the pyramid: Unit tests

-   Write unit tests for individual functions, methods, and modules of the app
    using XCTest framework. These tests should ensure that each function and
    module is working as expected.

Differences between Senior 1 and Senior 2: At the senior 2 level, an iOS
developer should have a deeper understanding of software testing principles and
practices. They should be able to design a test pyramid that provides
comprehensive test coverage, ensures maintainability, and non-overlapping
coverage. In addition, they should be able to incorporate different types of
testing techniques and tools, such as performance and security testing, into the
testing strategy. Finally, they should be able to work with the team to
continuously improve the testing process and ensure that the app meets the
highest quality standards. ÃŸ
