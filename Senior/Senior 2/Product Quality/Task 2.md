# Task 2

Task: You are working on a new feature for a complex iOS application, and you
want to ensure that your team's test coverage is comprehensive and maintainable.
Define a test pyramid with non-overlapping coverage areas, and provide examples
of tests that would fall into each category.

Solution:

A maintainable test pyramid is a good way to ensure comprehensive testing while
also keeping test suite runtimes manageable. The three layers of the pyramid are
unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

1. Unit Tests: These tests are the foundation of the test pyramid, and they
   focus on testing small, independent pieces of code. Unit tests should be
   fast, reliable, and easy to run. Examples of unit tests include testing
   individual methods or functions, and testing model objects.
2. Integration Tests: These tests sit in the middle of the pyramid and focus on
   testing the interactions between different components of your app.
   Integration tests ensure that your app's modules are working together
   correctly. Examples of integration tests include testing API calls, testing
   data persistence, and testing the interactions between view controllers and
   their corresponding views.
3. End-to-End Tests: These tests sit at the top of the pyramid and focus on
   testing the complete end-to-end functionality of your app. End-to-end tests
   ensure that your app is working correctly as a whole, and they are often
   slower and more complex to write than unit and integration tests. Examples of
   end-to-end tests include testing user flows and testing the app's behavior
   under various real-world scenarios.

Differences between Senior 2 and Senior 1:

-   The senior 2 developer has a deep understanding of the importance of test
    coverage and can apply a range of testing techniques to ensure the quality
    of the application.
-   The senior 2 developer is able to work with and improve existing test
    suites, not just create new ones.
-   The senior 2 developer has experience with test automation and can use tools
    such as XCUITest and XCTest to write effective and efficient tests.
-   The senior 2 developer is able to balance test coverage with runtime and
    maintenance concerns, and is able to make trade-offs as necessary to ensure
    that testing remains maintainable over time.
