# Task 1

Task:

Your team is developing a new feature for an iOS app, and you need to add a new
third-party library using CocoaPods. The library you need to add is called
"Alamofire", and you need to add it to your project to make HTTP requests to an
API.

Write the steps you would take to add the "Alamofire" library to your project
using CocoaPods.

Differences indicating development to Junior 3:

The key difference between a Junior 2 and Junior 3 developer in this task is the
ability to troubleshoot issues that may arise during the process of adding a new
library. A Junior 3 developer should be able to independently research and solve
any problems that occur, as well as have a deeper understanding of the impact
that new dependencies may have on the project as a whole. Additionally, a Junior
3 developer should be able to effectively communicate the steps they took and
any issues they encountered to their team.
