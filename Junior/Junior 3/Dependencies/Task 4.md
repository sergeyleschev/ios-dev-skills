# Task 4

Test task: Implement a third-party library in your iOS project using Cocoapods

Description:

1. Choose a third-party library that you think will be useful for your project
   (e.g. Alamofire, SwiftyJSON, Kingfisher, etc.)
2. Use Cocoapods to install the library in your project
3. Import the library into your Swift file and use its functionality (e.g. make
   a network request with Alamofire, parse JSON data with SwiftyJSON, load an
   image with Kingfisher, etc.)
4. Make sure your code is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices

Differences between Junior 2 and Junior 3 level:

-   Junior 3 developers should be able to choose appropriate third-party
    libraries for their projects based on their needs and requirements.
-   Junior 3 developers should have a good understanding of Cocoapods and be
    able to use it effectively to manage dependencies in their projects.
-   Junior 3 developers should be able to integrate third-party libraries into
    their projects and use them to enhance the functionality of their apps.
-   Junior 3 developers should be able to write clean, well-structured code that
    follows best practices when using third-party libraries.
