# Task 5

Test task: Implement a custom Cocoapods library in your iOS project

Description:

1. Create a new Cocoapods library project using the **`pod lib create`**
   command.
2. Implement a custom functionality in the library (e.g. a custom view, a
   utility class, a networking layer, etc.).
3. Publish the library to a private or public Cocoapods repository.
4. Use the library in your iOS project by adding it to your **`Podfile`** and
   installing it with Cocoapods.
5. Import the library into your Swift file and use its functionality in your
   project.

Differences between Junior 2 and Junior 3 level:

-   Junior 3 developers should have a good understanding of how to create and
    publish their own Cocoapods libraries.
-   Junior 3 developers should be able to implement custom functionality in
    their libraries that can be used by other developers in their projects.
-   Junior 3 developers should be able to effectively use Cocoapods to manage
    dependencies in their projects and publish their own libraries.
-   Junior 3 developers should be able to write clean, well-documented, and
    reusable code when creating their own Cocoapods libraries.
