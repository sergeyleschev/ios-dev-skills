# Task 4

Task: You're working on a chat app that displays a list of conversations in a
table view. Each conversation has a title and a message. You've noticed that the
table view is sluggish and takes a long time to load, especially when there are
many conversations. How would you go about optimizing the table view's
performance and avoiding memory leaks?

Solution: To optimize the table view's performance and avoid memory leaks, here
are some steps you can take:

1. Use reusable cells: Instead of creating a new cell for each conversation,
   reuse cells by dequeuing them from the table view's reuse pool. This will
   reduce the memory footprint of the table view and improve performance.
2. Load data asynchronously: Load the conversation data asynchronously, so that
   the table view can display some conversations even before all of them have
   been loaded. This will make the table view appear more responsive.
3. Use lazy loading: Load conversations only when they are needed, rather than
   loading all conversations at once. This will reduce the amount of memory used
   by the app and improve performance.
4. Use instruments to find memory leaks: Use Xcode's Instruments tool to find
   memory leaks and fix them. This will ensure that the app does not consume too
   much memory and does not crash due to memory issues.
5. Use appropriate data structures: Use appropriate data structures to store
   conversation data, such as arrays or dictionaries, to optimize performance.

In addition to these steps, at the junior 3 level, the developer should also
have a good understanding of ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and be able to
handle retain cycles and weak references. They should be able to identify and
fix memory leaks and optimize performance in a more advanced manner than a
junior 2 level developer.
