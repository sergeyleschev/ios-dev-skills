# Task 2

Task: Create a sign-up screen that allows users to input their name, email,
password, and confirm password.

Solution:

1. Open Xcode and create a new project with a Single View App template.
2. In the storyboard, drag a scroll view onto the view controller.
3. Add a content view inside the scroll view to hold the sign-up form.
4. Drag text fields for the user's name, email, password, and confirm password
   onto the content view.
5. Add appropriate constraints to make the UI work on different screen sizes.
6. Set the text fields' placeholder text and secure text entry properties as
   needed.
7. Add a sign-up button at the bottom of the screen.
8. Implement a validation function to check if the user's input is valid.
9. Connect the sign-up button to a function that handles the sign-up logic.
10. Build and run the app to test the sign-up screen.

Differences from Junior 2 level:

-   Junior 3 level should be able to create more complex forms with validation
    logic to ensure the input data is correct.
-   Junior 3 level should be able to handle user input and interact with backend
    services to complete the sign-up process.
-   Junior 3 level should have a better understanding of data validation and
    user input handling to create more robust and secure apps.
