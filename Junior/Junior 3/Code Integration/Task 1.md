# Task 1

Task: As an iOS Developer level Junior 3, you are assigned to a project that
uses Git for version control. Your task is to merge a feature branch into the
main branch using Git.

Solution:

1. Checkout the main branch: **`git checkout main`**
2. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository: **`git pull`**
3. Merge the feature branch into the main branch: **`git merge feature-branch`**
4. Resolve any merge conflicts that arise.
5. Commit the merge changes:
   **`git commit -m "Merge feature-branch into main"`**
6. Push the changes to the remote repository: **`git push`**

Differences between Junior 3 and Junior 2:

-   Junior 3 should be able to handle more complex merge scenarios, such as
    merging a feature branch with multiple commits and resolving merge
    conflicts.
-   Junior 3 should have a deeper understanding of Git and version control,
    including more advanced concepts such as rebasing and cherry-picking.
-   Junior 3 should be able to use Git to collaborate effectively with other
    developers on a team.
