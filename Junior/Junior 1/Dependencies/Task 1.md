Task: Add a new dependency using Cocoapods

Description: As a junior iOS developer, you should know how to use Cocoapods to
manage dependencies in your project. In this task, you will add a new dependency
to an existing project using Cocoapods.

Steps:

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the command "pod init" to create a new Podfile.
3. Open the Podfile in your preferred text editor.
4. Add a new dependency to the Podfile using the following format:

    pod 'DependencyName', '~> VersionNumber'

    Replace "DependencyName" with the name of the dependency you want to add and
    "VersionNumber" with the version you want to use. You can find this
    information on the dependency's website or Github page.

5. Save the Podfile and close the text editor.
6. Run the command "pod install" in the terminal to install the new dependency.
7. Wait for the installation process to complete.
8. Open your project in Xcode and verify that the new dependency has been added
   successfully.
9. Build and run your project to ensure that the new dependency is working
   correctly.

Expected outcome: The new dependency should be added to the project successfully
and should work as expected.

Time limit: 15 minutes.
