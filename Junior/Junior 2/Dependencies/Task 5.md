# Task 5

Task: Integration with a third-party library

You are working on a new feature for your iOS app, and your team has decided to
use a third-party library to implement some of the functionality. The library
you will be using is Alamofire, which is a popular networking library that can
simplify making HTTP requests.

Your task is to integrate the Alamofire library into your project using
Cocoapods.

Steps:

1. Open the Terminal and navigate to the root directory of your Xcode project.
2. Create a Podfile by running the command **`pod init`** in the Terminal.
3. Open the Podfile using Xcode or another text editor.
4. Add the following line to the Podfile: **`pod 'Alamofire'`**
5. Save the Podfile and exit the text editor.
6. In the Terminal, run the command **`pod install`**.
7. Wait for the Alamofire library to download and install.
8. Open your Xcode project using the **`.xcworkspace`** file that was created by
   Cocoapods.
9. Import the Alamofire module into the file where you will be using it.
10. Use the Alamofire library to make an HTTP request and handle the response
    appropriately.

Differences from Junior 1: The Junior 2 developer should be able to confidently
integrate third-party libraries into their project using Cocoapods, and
understand how to use the library's functionality in their code. They should
also be able to handle any issues that may arise during the installation or use
of the library.
