# Task 3

Task: Create a new iOS project and add the Alamofire library using Cocoapods.
Use Alamofire to make a network request to an API and display the results in a
table view. The table view should have a custom cell with at least two labels
and an image view. The image view should display an image downloaded from the
API. Use a third-party library to download and cache the image.

Differences from Junior 1 level task: This task involves integrating a
third-party library to download and cache images, demonstrating the developer's
ability to work with multiple dependencies and handle more complex requirements.
Additionally, the task involves displaying data in a custom table view cell,
indicating a deeper understanding of UIKit and interface building.
