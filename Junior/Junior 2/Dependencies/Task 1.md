Task: Add a new dependency using Cocoapods

Description: As a Junior 2 level iOS developer, you should be able to add new
dependencies to an existing project using Cocoapods. In this task, you will add
a new dependency to your project and integrate it into your existing codebase.

Steps:

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the command "pod search DependencyName" in the terminal to search for the
   dependency you want to add.
3. Identify the latest version of the dependency and note down its name and
   version number.
4. Open the Podfile in your preferred text editor.
5. Add a new line to the Podfile with the name of the dependency and its version
   number.

    pod 'DependencyName', '~> version_number'

6. Save the Podfile and close the text editor.
7. Run the command "pod install" in the terminal to install the new dependency.
8. Wait for the installation process to complete.
9. Open your project in Xcode and verify that the new dependency has been added
   successfully.
10. Import the new dependency into your codebase and use it as needed.

Differences that indicate a Junior 2 level developer:

1. Knowledge of how to search for a new dependency using Cocoapods.
2. Ability to identify the latest version of a dependency.
3. Understanding of the syntax for adding a new dependency to the Podfile.
4. Familiarity with the "pod install" command to install a new dependency.
5. Ability to import and use the new dependency in the codebase.

Expected outcome: The new dependency should be successfully added to the project
and integrated into the codebase.

Time limit: 15 minutes.
