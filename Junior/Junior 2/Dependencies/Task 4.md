# Task 4

Task: Create a new Xcode project and add a third-party library using CocoaPods.

Instructions:

1. Create a new Xcode project.
2. Create a Podfile and add a third-party library of your choice.
3. Run 'pod install' in Terminal to install the library.
4. Open the workspace file and import the library into your project.
5. Use the library in your project, for example by adding an instance of a class
   from the library to a view controller.

Difference from Junior 1 level: In this task, the developer is expected to not
only know how to use CocoaPods to install a third-party library, but also to add
the library to their Xcode project and use it in their code. This requires a
deeper understanding of how CocoaPods works and how to integrate third-party
code into an existing project.
