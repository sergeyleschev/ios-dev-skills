# Task 5

Task: Create a table view that displays a list of items. Each item should have
an image, a title, and a description.

Solution:

1. Open Xcode and create a new project with a Single View App template.
2. In the storyboard, drag a Table View onto the view controller.
3. Set the Table View's data source and delegate to the view controller.
4. Create a custom cell with an image view, a label for the title, and a label
   for the description.
5. Register the custom cell class with the Table View.
6. In the view controller, create a data source array of items to display in the
   Table View.
7. Implement the Table View's data source methods to display the items in the
   Table View using the custom cell.
8. Build and run the app to test the table view.

Differences from Junior 1 level:

-   Junior 2 level should be able to create custom cells with multiple UI
    components.
-   Junior 2 level should be able to use the Table View's data source and
    delegate methods to populate the table view with data.
-   Junior 2 level should have a better understanding of the Table View's
    lifecycle and be able to handle more complex interactions, such as row
    selection and deletion.
