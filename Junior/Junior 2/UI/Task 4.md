# Task 4

Task: Create a login screen with two text fields (username and password) and a
button to login. Add appropriate constraints to make the UI work on different
screen sizes.

Solution:

1. Open Xcode and create a new project with a Single View App template.
2. In the storyboard, drag two text fields and a button onto the view
   controller.
3. Add placeholder text for the username and password text fields.
4. Add a label for the login screen title.
5. Add appropriate constraints to make the UI work on different screen sizes.
   Use autolayout code instead of Storyboard.
6. Create IBOutlets for the text fields and button in the view controller.
7. In the view controller, add an IBAction function for the login button to
   handle login logic.
8. Build and run the app to test the login screen.

Differences from Junior 1 level:

-   Junior 2 level should have a better understanding of autolayout constraints
    and be able to use code instead of relying on Storyboard.
-   Junior 2 level should also be able to handle more complex UI components and
    layout arrangements.
