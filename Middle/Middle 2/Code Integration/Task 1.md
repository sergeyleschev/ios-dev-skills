# Task 1

Task:

You have been working on a new feature branch in a project and you've made a
commit with some new functionality that needs to be merged into the main branch.
However, before you do that, you need to make sure that your code doesn't
conflict with any changes that may have been made on the main branch since you
started working on your feature. Your task is to use Git to perform the
following steps:

1. Fetch the latest changes from the main branch.
2. Merge the changes into your feature branch.
3. Resolve any merge conflicts that may arise.
4. Push your changes to the feature branch.

Solution:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Run the following command to fetch the latest changes from the main branch:

```bash
git fetch origin main
```

3. Switch to your feature branch by running the following command:

```bash
git checkout feature-branch
```

4. Merge the changes from the main branch into your feature branch using the
   following command:

```bash
git merge main
```

5. If there are any merge conflicts, Git will notify you and show you the files
   that need to be resolved. Use your code editor to resolve the conflicts, save
   the changes, and then stage the files using the following command:

```bash
git add <file>
```

6. After resolving all conflicts, commit the changes by running the following
   command:

```bash
git commit -m "Merge changes from main branch"
```

7. Finally, push your changes to the feature branch by running the following
   command:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

Differences from Middle 1:

-   This task requires the developer to have a good understanding of Git,
    including fetching and merging changes from different branches, resolving
    merge conflicts, and pushing changes to a remote repository.
-   This task also requires the developer to have good problem-solving skills
    and the ability to identify and resolve merge conflicts in a timely and
    efficient manner.
-   The developer must also have a good understanding of version control
    workflows and the importance of keeping different branches up-to-date with
    the latest changes.
