# Task 1

Task:

You have a long-running task that needs to be executed in the background thread,
but you also need to update the UI based on the results of this task. Write a
code snippet that shows how you can achieve this using Grand Central Dispatch
(GCD).

Solution:

To execute a long-running task in the background thread and update the UI based
on its results, you can use GCD. Here's an example code snippet that
demonstrates how you can achieve this:

```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async {
    // Perform long-running task here

    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // Update UI based on task results
    }
}
```

In this code, we use the **`DispatchQueue.global(qos: .background).async`**
method to execute the long-running task in a background thread with a lower
quality of service (QoS) level. This ensures that the task does not block the
main thread and cause the UI to freeze.

Once the task is complete, we use **`DispatchQueue.main.async`** to switch back
to the main thread and update the UI based on the task results. This ensures
that the UI updates are performed on the main thread, which is necessary to
avoid synchronization issues.

Difference from the Middle 1 level:

The code snippet above shows an understanding of how to use GCD to execute a
long-running task in the background thread and update the UI based on its
results. This demonstrates an intermediate level of proficiency with
multithreading concepts and a better understanding of GCD's role in iOS
development.
