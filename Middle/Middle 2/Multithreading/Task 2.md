# Task 2

Task:

You need to download and display an image from a remote server in an iOS app.
Write a code snippet that demonstrates how you can achieve this using
asynchronous programming and thread synchronization.

Solution:

To download and display an image from a remote server, we can use the URLSession
class to create a data task, download the image data, and then display it in a
UIImageView. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to achieve
this using asynchronous programming and thread synchronization:

```swift
let session = URLSession(configuration: .default)
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/image.jpg")!

session.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
    guard let data = data, error == nil else {
        print(error?.localizedDescription ?? "Unknown error")
        return
    }

    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        let image = UIImage(data: data)
        imageView.image = image
    }
}.resume()
```

In this code, we use the **`URLSession`** class to create a data task that
downloads the image data from the remote server. The data task is executed
asynchronously, which means that it does not block the main thread.

Once the data task is complete, we use **`DispatchQueue.main.async`** to switch
back to the main thread and display the downloaded image in a **`UIImageView`**.
This ensures that the UI updates are performed on the main thread, which is
necessary to avoid synchronization issues.

Difference from the Middle 1 level:

The code snippet above shows an understanding of how to use asynchronous
programming and thread synchronization to download and display an image from a
remote server. This demonstrates an intermediate level of proficiency with
multithreading concepts and a better understanding of how to use URLSession to
perform network operations asynchronously.
