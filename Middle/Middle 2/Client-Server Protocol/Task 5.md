# Task 5

Task: Design and implement a caching mechanism to improve the performance of a
network request. The mechanism should cache the response data from the server
and use it to fulfill future requests for the same data until the cache expires
or is invalidated. The caching should work seamlessly with UIKit and be
configurable.

Solution:

To implement the caching mechanism, we can use the URLCache class provided by
Foundation framework. We can create a custom URLSessionConfiguration object and
set the urlCache property to an instance of URLCache with our desired cache
configuration.

Here's some sample code:

```swift
let cache = URLCache(memoryCapacity: 10 * 1024 * 1024, diskCapacity: 50 * 1024 * 1024, diskPath: "myCache")
let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
configuration.urlCache = cache
let session = URLSession(configuration: configuration)

let url = URL(string: "https://example.com/data.json")!
let request = URLRequest(url: url)

let task = session.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
    if let data = data {
        // process data
    } else {
        // handle error
    }
}
task.resume()
```

In this example, we create a URLCache object with 10 MB of memory capacity and
50 MB of disk capacity, and a disk path of "myCache". We then create a
URLSessionConfiguration object and set its urlCache property to our cache
object. Finally, we create a URLSession object with the configuration and use it
to make a network request.

To configure the cache expiration and validation, we can use the various
properties of the URLCache class. For example, we can set the memoryCapacity and
diskCapacity properties to limit the size of the cache, and set the maximumAge
and maximumStale properties to control when cached responses expire or become
stale.

The key difference between a middle 2 developer and a middle 1 developer in this
task might be their ability to handle more complex caching scenarios, such as
handling cache invalidation based on server-side changes or dynamically
adjusting cache policies based on network conditions. They might also have a
better understanding of the impact of caching on app performance and be able to
optimize the caching mechanism accordingly.
