# Task 2

Task: Develop a feature to allow users to send images in a chat conversation,
including the ability to take a photo or select one from their device's photo
library.

Solution: To allow users to send images in a chat conversation, we need to add a
button to the chat interface that opens the camera or photo library. Once the
user selects an image, we need to upload it to the server and send the image URL
in the chat message. We can use the UIImagePickerController class to handle
image selection from the camera or photo library. We also need to ensure that
the images are properly compressed and optimized for faster upload and download
times. To handle potential errors or network issues, we can implement
appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms.

Differences from Middle 1 level: At the Middle 2 level, the developer should
have a deeper understanding of handling media assets like images and videos
within an app. They should also be able to design and implement more complex
features with multiple components, like the ability to select and upload images
in a chat conversation. Additionally, at this level, the developer should be
more experienced in handling potential issues like slow network speeds and
server errors, and implementing appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms.
