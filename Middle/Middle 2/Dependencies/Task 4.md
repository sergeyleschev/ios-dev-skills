# Task 4

Task:

Explain the difference between static and dynamic linking and how it relates to
the use of Carthage for dependency management in iOS development.

Answer:

Static linking is the process of linking a library directly into the final
binary executable at compile time, while dynamic linking is the process of
loading the library at runtime when it is needed. Carthage uses dynamic linking
to manage dependencies, which allows for greater flexibility in updating and
managing dependencies without the need to recompile the entire project. This is
in contrast to SPM, which uses static linking and requires a full recompilation
of the project for any changes to take effect. As an iOS developer at the Middle
2 level, it's important to understand the trade-offs and benefits of both static
and dynamic linking and choose the appropriate dependency management tool based
on the specific needs of the project. In addition to understanding the technical
differences between dependency management tools, a Middle 2 iOS developer should
also have a deeper understanding of how to choose and evaluate dependencies for
a project based on factors such as security, maintainability, and performance.
