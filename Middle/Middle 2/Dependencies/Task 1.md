# Task 1

Task:

As an iOS developer, you're tasked with integrating a third-party library into
your app. The library has several dependencies, and you need to decide whether
to use Carthage or CocoaPods to manage them. Please provide a brief explanation
of the factors you would consider in making this decision.

Answer:

When deciding between Carthage and CocoaPods, there are several factors to
consider:

1. Integration: CocoaPods integrates directly with Xcode, making it easier to
   set up and manage. Carthage, on the other hand, requires more manual
   integration, but it has the advantage of being more flexible.
2. Build times: CocoaPods builds all dependencies as part of the main project
   build process, which can slow down build times. Carthage, on the other hand,
   builds dependencies separately, which can improve build times.
3. Frameworks vs libraries: CocoaPods supports both libraries and frameworks,
   while Carthage only supports frameworks. If the library you're integrating
   uses a library rather than a framework, you'll need to use CocoaPods.
4. Versioning: CocoaPods manages versioning centrally, which can be both a
   blessing and a curse. Carthage, on the other hand, leaves versioning up to
   the individual projects, which can lead to more flexibility but can also be
   more difficult to manage.

Differences between Middle 2 and Middle 1 level:

At the Middle 2 level, the developer should be able to not only choose the right
dependency manager for the job but also understand the implications of their
decision. They should be able to manage dependencies across multiple projects
and handle complex dependency graphs. Additionally, they should be able to
troubleshoot any issues that arise during the integration process and be
comfortable working with both libraries and frameworks. The developer should
also be able to assess the impact of dependencies on performance and make
informed decisions about trade-offs.
