# Task 3

Task:

You've been tasked with integrating a new third-party library into an existing
iOS app that uses Carthage to manage dependencies. However, the library is not
compatible with the current version of Carthage. Please explain the steps you
would take to resolve this issue.

Answer:

To resolve this issue, I would take the following steps:

1. Check compatibility: First, I would check the compatibility of the library
   with the current version of Carthage. If the library is not compatible, I
   would check if it is compatible with a newer version of Carthage.
2. Upgrade Carthage: If the library is not compatible with the current version
   of Carthage, I would upgrade Carthage to the latest version. This may require
   updating other dependencies as well.
3. Install the library: Once Carthage is upgraded, I would add the library to
   the Cartfile and run **`carthage update`** to install it.
4. Check compatibility with the app: After installing the library, I would check
   that it is compatible with the app and make any necessary changes to the app
   code.
5. Test and deploy: Finally, I would test the app thoroughly to ensure that the
   new library is functioning correctly and deploy it to production.

Differences between Middle 2 and Middle 1 level:

At the Middle 2 level, the developer should be able to handle more complex
dependency management issues, such as resolving compatibility issues between
dependencies. They should have a deep understanding of the dependency management
system they are using and be able to troubleshoot issues that arise.
Additionally, they should be able to optimize the dependency management process
by identifying and removing unnecessary dependencies and be able to evaluate new
tools and systems for managing dependencies. Finally, they should be able to
communicate effectively with stakeholders about dependency management decisions
and the impact they will have on the project.
