# Task 2

Task:

You've been tasked with upgrading an existing iOS app that uses CocoaPods to
manage dependencies to a newer version of Xcode. However, you've encountered
issues with the dependency management system and are considering switching to a
different tool. Please provide a brief explanation of the factors you would
consider in making this decision.

Answer:

When considering switching dependency management tools, there are several
factors to consider:

1. Compatibility: The new tool must be compatible with the version of Xcode
   you're using and any other tools you're using in your development process.
2. Migration: If you switch tools, you'll need to migrate your existing
   dependencies to the new tool. This can be a time-consuming process, so you'll
   need to factor that in when making your decision.
3. Integration: The new tool must integrate with your build process and
   development workflow. You'll need to consider how the new tool will fit into
   your existing processes.
4. Community support: You'll want to choose a tool with an active community and
   good documentation. This will make it easier to troubleshoot any issues that
   arise and stay up to date with new features and updates.

Differences between Middle 2 and Middle 1 level:

At the Middle 2 level, the developer should be able to not only choose the right
dependency manager for the job but also assess the trade-offs of switching
tools. They should be able to evaluate the impact of switching on the project
timeline and be able to communicate the benefits and drawbacks of different
options to stakeholders. Additionally, they should be comfortable managing
dependencies across multiple projects and be able to troubleshoot complex issues
that arise during the upgrade process. The developer should also be able to
evaluate the long-term impact of dependency management decisions and make
informed decisions about the future of the project.
