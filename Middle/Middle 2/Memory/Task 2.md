# Task 2

Task: Given an iOS app that uses multiple view controllers, identify and fix any
memory leaks in the app.

Solution:

1. Run the app using the Debug Navigator in Xcode and monitor the memory usage.
2. Use the Allocations tool in Xcode to identify any memory leaks. Look for
   objects that are being retained but never released.
3. Use the leaks instrument to identify any objects that are not being released
   properly.
4. Check for retain cycles by using the Memory Graph Debugger in Xcode.
5. Fix the memory leaks by adding the appropriate memory management code, such
   as setting object references to nil when they are no longer needed.
6. Test the app again to ensure that the memory leaks have been fixed and that
   the memory usage is stable.

Differences that indicate the development of the developer to the level of
Middle 2 from the level of Middle 1:

1. Ability to identify and fix more complex memory leaks in the app.
2. Ability to optimize memory usage and reduce the app's overall memory
   footprint.
3. Knowledge of advanced memory management techniques, such as using weak and
   unowned references to avoid retain cycles.
4. Understanding of how to use Xcode tools to debug and profile memory usage in
   the app.
5. Ability to explain memory management concepts to junior developers and
   provide guidance on best practices.
