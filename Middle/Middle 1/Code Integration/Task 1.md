# Task 1

Task: You are working on a project with a team of developers, and you have just
received a pull request from one of your teammates. Your task is to review the
changes made in the pull request and provide feedback to your teammate.

Solution:

1. Start by reading through the changes made in the pull request, and make sure
   you understand what your teammate was trying to achieve with their changes.
2. Check if the code is well-formatted, adheres to the coding standards, and has
   comments where necessary.
3. Test the code changes by building and running the application locally, to
   make sure that the new changes have not introduced any new bugs.
4. Make suggestions for improvements and provide constructive feedback to your
   teammate. This could include ways to optimize code, improve readability, or
   make the code more modular.
5. Once you have provided feedback, wait for your teammate to make the necessary
   changes and re-submit the pull request for review.
