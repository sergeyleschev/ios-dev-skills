# Task 2

Task:

You are working on a project with multiple contributors, and you need to create
a new branch for a feature you're working on. Create a new branch called
"feature/my-feature" and push it to the remote repository.

Solution:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to your project directory using the **`cd`**
   command.
2. Checkout to the branch you want to create a new branch from using the command
   **`git checkout <branch-name>`**.
3. Create a new branch using the command **`git branch feature/my-feature`**.
4. Switch to the new branch using the command
   **`git checkout feature/my-feature`**.
5. Push the new branch to the remote repository using the command
   **`git push -u origin feature/my-feature`**.

Differences from Junior 3 level:

This task requires the developer to have a deeper understanding of Git and how
to create and manage branches. It also introduces the concept of remote
repositories and how to push changes to them. In addition, it requires the
developer to follow a specific naming convention for the branch, which
demonstrates attention to detail and adherence to best practices.
