# Task 2

Task:

You are working on an iOS app that performs some heavy calculations in the
background. The calculations are triggered by a user action and take a few
seconds to complete. The app freezes while the calculations are being performed,
making the user experience poor. Your task is to improve the app's performance
by implementing multithreading techniques.

Solution:

To improve the app's performance, you can use Grand Central Dispatch (GCD) to
perform the heavy calculations on a separate background thread. This will
prevent the main thread from freezing and provide a smoother user experience.

Here's an example of how to use GCD:

```swift
DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async {
    // Perform heavy calculations here
    // ...
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        // Update UI on the main thread here
        // ...
    }
}
```

In this example, the heavy calculations are performed on a background thread
using the **`DispatchQueue.global(qos: .userInitiated).async`** method. Once the
calculations are complete, the UI is updated on the main thread using
**`DispatchQueue.main.async`**.

This approach ensures that the heavy calculations are performed in the
background without freezing the main thread, while the UI updates are performed
on the main thread to avoid any threading issues. By implementing this
technique, you can significantly improve the app's performance and provide a
better user experience.

The difference between a junior developer and a middle developer in this
scenario is that a middle developer has a deeper understanding of multithreading
concepts, including thread synchronization and avoiding race conditions. They
also have experience with more advanced multithreading techniques, such as using
dispatch groups and barriers to optimize performance.
