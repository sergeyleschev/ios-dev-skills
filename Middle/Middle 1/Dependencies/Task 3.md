# Task 3

Task: Implement a custom logger using the CocoaLumberjack framework that logs to
both the console and a file.

Requirements:

-   The logger should have 5 different log levels: debug, info, warning, error,
    and severe.
-   The logger should use the console and a file to store the logs.
-   The file name should be in the format "logs-yyyy-MM-dd.txt", where
    "yyyy-MM-dd" is the current date.
-   The file should be stored in the app's documents directory.
-   The log format should include the date and time, log level, and log message.

Differences between Middle 1 and Junior 3 level:

-   Understanding of the importance of logging and how it can aid in debugging
    and troubleshooting complex applications.
-   Ability to implement custom logging solutions using third-party libraries.
-   Familiarity with file management and directory structures in iOS
    applications.
