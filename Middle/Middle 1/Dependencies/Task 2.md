# Task 2

Task: Troubleshoot dependency conflicts

Description:

1. Create a new iOS project and add two popular third-party libraries using
   Carthage.
2. Configure your project to link the libraries' binaries and headers using
   Carthage.
3. Use the libraries' functionality in your project by importing them and
   calling their methods or classes.
4. Test the libraries to ensure that they work correctly and do not cause any
   conflicts with each other or with the rest of your project.
5. Introduce a conflict between the two libraries by using conflicting methods
   or classes.
6. Use your knowledge of dependency management to resolve the conflict and
   ensure that both libraries work together smoothly.

Differences between Junior 3 and Middle 1 level:

-   Middle 1 developers should have a deep understanding of how to troubleshoot
    dependency conflicts and resolve them efficiently, using a range of tools
    and techniques.
-   Middle 1 developers should be able to identify potential conflicts between
    different dependencies and make informed decisions about which libraries to
    use based on their compatibility with other dependencies.
-   Middle 1 developers should be able to write clean, efficient code that
    avoids dependency conflicts and uses third-party libraries effectively and
    efficiently.
-   Middle 1 developers should be able to work effectively with other developers
    and teams to resolve complex dependency issues and ensure that all
    dependencies work together seamlessly.
