# Task 1

Task: Design and implement a chat module that allows users to send and receive
text messages in real-time. The module should use a WebSocket connection to
communicate with the server, and support sending messages to specific users or
groups. The UI should be clean and intuitive, with support for displaying
message history and showing when users are typing.

Solution: To implement the chat module, I would use the Swift programming
language along with the Foundation and UIKit frameworks. I would start by
setting up a WebSocket connection to the server using the
URLSessionWebSocketTask class. I would then create a UI for the chat module
using UITableView to display message history and UITextField for inputting
messages. I would also use the UIActivityIndicatorView to show when a user is
typing. Finally, I would implement logic for sending and receiving messages, as
well as displaying them in the UI.

Differences between Junior 3 and Middle 1: At the Middle 1 level, the developer
should have a deeper understanding of network communication protocols and be
able to implement real-time chat using WebSockets. They should also have a
strong understanding of UI/UX design principles and be able to create a clean
and intuitive interface for the chat module. Additionally, the developer should
be able to handle more complex logic for sending and receiving messages, such as
implementing message encryption and decryption or implementing message
threading.
