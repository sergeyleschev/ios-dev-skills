# Task 4

Task: Design and implement a chat module that supports real-time messaging,
offline message synchronization, and user authentication using Firebase Realtime
Database.

Solution:

1. Set up Firebase Realtime Database in your Xcode project and configure
   Firebase Authentication to handle user authentication.
2. Design the user interface of your chat module, including a list of
   conversations, a chat view, and a login/register screen.
3. Implement a data model for storing messages and conversations using Firebase
   Realtime Database.
4. Add logic for real-time messaging by setting up Firebase listeners to update
   the UI in real-time whenever new messages are added.
5. Add logic for offline message synchronization by storing messages locally and
   uploading them to the Firebase Realtime Database when a user comes back
   online.
6. Implement user authentication using Firebase Authentication to ensure that
   only authenticated users can use your chat module.

Differences between Junior 3 and Middle 1:

The task for a Middle 1 developer requires more advanced skills in implementing
a chat module with more complex features. It also requires an understanding of
how to work with Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Authentication, which
are not typically covered in Junior 3 level tasks. Additionally, the Middle 1
task requires the developer to design the user interface of the chat module,
whereas the Junior 3 tasks focused more on data manipulation and API
integration.
