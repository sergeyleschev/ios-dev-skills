# Task 3

Task: Implement a chat module with the following requirements:

-   Users should be able to send and receive text messages in real-time.
-   Messages should be saved locally and displayed in the chat history.
-   The chat should support sending images and videos.
-   The user interface should be designed in a clean and user-friendly way.

Solution:

To implement the chat module, we can use Firebase Realtime Database and Storage.
First, we need to create a Firebase project and configure it in our Xcode
project. Then, we can create a "Chat" model to represent a single message, with
properties like the sender, timestamp, message content, and media URL.

Next, we can create a view controller to display the chat messages. We can use a
UITableView to show the messages in a list, with each cell representing a single
message. We can also add an input bar at the bottom of the screen to allow users
to type their messages and send them.

To send a message, we can listen for the "Send" button tap event and create a
new "Chat" object with the user's ID, the current timestamp, and the message
text. We can then save this object to Firebase Realtime Database. If the user
also wants to send an image or video, we can use Firebase Storage to upload the
media file and save the download URL in the "Chat" object.

To receive messages in real-time, we can listen for changes to the "Chat"
objects in the Firebase database and update the UITableView accordingly. We can
also use Firebase Storage to download and display any images or videos
associated with the messages.

As for the user interface, we can use a simple and clean design with clear
labels and icons to indicate message sender and message type. We can also use a
custom cell layout to display images and videos in the chat history. Finally, we
can add features like swipe-to-delete and pull-to-refresh to enhance the user
experience.

Differences from Junior 3: The Middle 1 developer should be able to design and
implement a more complex feature like a chat module from scratch using
third-party libraries and/or cloud services like Firebase. They should have a
deeper understanding of data modeling, real-time communication, and user
interface design principles. They should also be able to write clean and
maintainable code that can be easily extended and tested.
