# Task 2

Task: You are tasked with creating a chat module for an existing iOS app. The
chat module should be fast and reliable, and should support sending and
receiving messages in real-time. Additionally, the module should have a feature
that allows users to see if the other user is typing a message.

Solution:

To solve this task, you can use a variety of tools and technologies, such as:

-   Firebase Realtime Database: Use this to store and sync data between multiple
    clients in real-time.
-   Socket.IO: Use this library to create a real-time bidirectional
    communication between the server and the client.
-   UICollectionView: Use this to display the chat messages in a list.
-   UIKit: Use this to create the user interface of the chat module.

Here's a sample code snippet to get started:

```swift
// Initialize Firebase database
let ref = Database.database().reference()

// Listen for new messages
ref.child("messages").observe(.childAdded) { (snapshot) in
    if let message = snapshot.value as? [String: Any] {
        // Parse the message and add it to the collection view
    }
}

// Send a new message
let message = ["text": "Hello, world!", "sender": "Alice"]
ref.child("messages").childByAutoId().setValue(message)

// Listen for typing status
ref.child("typing").observe(.value) { (snapshot) in
    if let typing = snapshot.value as? Bool {
        // Update the UI to show the typing status
    }
}

// Send typing status
ref.child("typing").setValue(true)
```

The differences between Junior 3 and Middle 1 would be the complexity of the
task and the expected level of proficiency in the technical stack. For Middle 1,
the developer should be able to implement more advanced features such as
real-time messaging and typing indicators using third-party libraries and tools.
Additionally, the developer should have a deeper understanding of the technical
stack and be able to make design decisions that optimize for performance and
reliability.
