# Task 3

Task: Implement a simple chat application using Firebase Realtime Database and
RxSwift. The app should allow users to send messages to each other in real time
and display them in a chat log. Messages should be sent using a text input field
and displayed in a UITableView. Users should be able to sign in with their email
and password, and their messages should be associated with their account.

Solution:

1. Create a new Xcode project and add Firebase to it using Cocoapods or the
   Firebase SDK.
2. Implement a user authentication flow using Firebase Authentication to allow
   users to sign in with their email and password.
3. Create a Firebase Realtime Database instance and set up the necessary rules
   for read and write access.
4. Use RxSwift to observe changes to the database and display incoming messages
   in a UITableView.
5. Implement a text input field that allows users to send messages and write
   them to the database using RxSwift.
6. Associate each message with the user's account information, such as their UID
   or email.
7. Display the user's name or email in the chat log next to their messages.

Differences from Middle 2 level:

-   In this task, the developer needs to have knowledge of both Firebase and
    RxSwift, which are advanced topics in iOS development.
-   The developer needs to have experience implementing real-time communication
    features, which is a more complex task than the previous tasks.
-   The app involves user authentication, which requires knowledge of security
    best practices and Firebase Authentication.
-   The developer needs to have knowledge of integrating third-party libraries
    using Cocoapods or manual integration using the Firebase SDK. ßß
