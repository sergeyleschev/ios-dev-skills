# Task 2

Task: Develop a WebSocket-based real-time chat application that supports
end-to-end encryption.

Solution: To develop a WebSocket-based real-time chat application that supports
end-to-end encryption, we need to use a library like Starscream to manage
WebSocket connections and implement encryption logic using libraries like
CryptoSwift. Here are the high-level steps:

1. Create a WebSocket connection using the Starscream library.
2. Implement an authentication mechanism that securely exchanges encryption keys
   between users.
3. Implement end-to-end encryption using CryptoSwift library.
4. Send and receive messages over WebSocket connection.

To achieve the Middle 3 level, the developer should be able to understand and
implement end-to-end encryption for WebSocket-based real-time chat, which is a
more advanced topic compared to previous tasks. They should also be able to
handle the additional complexity of encryption and authentication without
sacrificing the performance and user experience of the chat application.
