# Task 4

Task: Develop a real-time chat application using WebSockets and implement
end-to-end encryption for the messages exchanged between users.

Solution:

To implement end-to-end encryption in our WebSocket-based chat application, we
can use the Signal Protocol, which is a well-established and secure encryption
protocol used by several messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, and Facebook
Messenger. Here are the steps to implement it:

1. Generate a public/private key pair for each user when they register or log in
   to the app.
2. When a user sends a message, encrypt it using the recipient's public key.
3. When the recipient receives the message, they can decrypt it using their
   private key.
4. To prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, the keys must be verified using a
   trusted mechanism, such as QR codes or a secure server.

In addition to the encryption, we can also implement other features such as
message caching, offline messaging, and push notifications to enhance the user
experience.

The main difference between this task and the previous one is that it requires
the implementation of end-to-end encryption, which is a more advanced security
feature that ensures the privacy of users' conversations. This task also
involves more complex algorithms and protocols compared to the previous one,
demonstrating the developer's advanced knowledge of security and encryption.
