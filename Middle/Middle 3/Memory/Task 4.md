# Task 4

Task:

You're working on an app that fetches and displays a list of data items. Your
team has noticed that the app's memory usage increases over time and suspect
there may be a memory leak. Your task is to investigate and fix any memory leaks
that you find.

Solution:

To investigate and fix any memory leaks in the app, I would take the following
steps:

1. Use Xcode's Instruments tool to profile the app's memory usage and identify
   any memory leaks.
2. Analyze the code where the memory leaks are occurring and try to identify the
   root cause of the leaks.
3. Fix the memory leaks by releasing any objects that are no longer needed,
   using weak or unowned references where appropriate, and avoiding strong
   reference cycles.
4. Test the app again using Instruments to verify that the memory leaks have
   been fixed.

Differences from Middle 2 level:

At the Middle 3 level, the developer should be able to not only identify and fix
memory leaks, but also have a deeper understanding of memory management in iOS
apps. They should be able to use more advanced techniques such as memory
optimization and profiling to ensure the app is running efficiently and without
leaks. Additionally, they should be able to optimize the app's memory usage in a
way that doesn't compromise its performance or user experience.
