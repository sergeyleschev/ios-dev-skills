# Task 5

Task: You are working on an iOS app that has a feature that allows users to take
photos and save them to a collection. The app is running slow and taking up a
lot of memory, and you suspect there may be a memory leak. Identify the possible
causes of the memory leak and provide a solution to fix it.

Solution: Possible causes of the memory leak could be that the photos are being
stored in memory and not being released properly, or that the photo collection
is not being deallocated when it should be.

To fix the issue, you can use a few techniques such as:

1. Use the appropriate methods to manage memory such as using weak or unowned
   references to avoid strong reference cycles.
2. Implement the didReceiveMemoryWarning method in your view controllers to
   release memory when the app receives a memory warning from the system.
3. Use the Instruments tool to profile the app and identify any memory leaks.
   Once a leak is identified, you can use the Heapshot Analysis feature to see
   the call stack and find the root cause of the leak.
4. Use autoreleasepool to release any unused memory from the collection.

By implementing these techniques, you can avoid and fix any memory leaks in your
app and improve its performance.
