# Task 3

Task:

You are working on a medium-sized iOS project and have been tasked with
implementing a new feature. The feature requires making use of an external
library that provides functionality the app currently does not have. Your team
has decided to use Carthage as the dependency manager for this library.

Please describe your approach to integrating this library into the project,
ensuring that it can be easily used by other parts of the codebase and that any
conflicts with existing dependencies are resolved.

Differences to Middle 2 level:

At this level, the interviewer should look for a deeper understanding of
dependency management concepts, such as dependency injection, and a better
ability to handle conflicts between dependencies. The candidate should be able
to explain how they would test the new feature, both from a functional and a
performance standpoint, and how they would integrate it with the rest of the
app's architecture. Additionally, the candidate should be able to articulate how
they would ensure that the new feature is scalable and maintainable over time.
