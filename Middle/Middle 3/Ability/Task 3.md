# Task 3

Task:

You are asked to build a chat module that supports group chats with large
numbers of users (up to 5000 users). The chat should support sending text
messages, photos, and audio messages. Additionally, users should be able to
react to messages with emojis and the chat should support real-time updates.

Write a brief outline of your approach to building this chat module, including
the architectural decisions you would make and any third-party libraries or
services you might use.

Solution:

To build this chat module, I would use a client-server architecture. The client
would be built using Swift, UIKit, and Foundation, while the server would be
built using a backend technology such as Node.js or Ruby on Rails. The server
would be responsible for storing and retrieving messages and sending real-time
updates to clients.

For the real-time updates, I would use a WebSocket library such as
[Socket.io](http://socket.io/) to enable bi-directional communication between
the client and server. I would also use a third-party push notification service
such as Firebase Cloud Messaging or Apple Push Notification Service to notify
users of new messages.

To support sending text messages, I would use the UITextView class in UIKit. For
sending photos and audio messages, I would use the UIImagePickerController class
to access the device's camera and microphone. To handle emojis, I would use a
third-party library such as EmojiKit or EmojiOne.

To ensure the chat module is fast and reliable, I would implement various
optimizations such as lazy loading of messages and images, caching, and
pagination. I would also use compression algorithms such as gzip to minimize the
amount of data being sent over the network.
