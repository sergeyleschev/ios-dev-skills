# Task 1

Task:

Design and implement a feature that allows users to send messages to a chatbot
using natural language processing (NLP). The chatbot should be able to
understand and respond to common phrases such as "hi," "how are you," "what is
the weather like," and "set a reminder for tomorrow at 2 pm." The feature should
also have a user interface that displays the chatbot's responses in a
conversation-like format.

Solution:

To implement this feature, we will need to integrate an NLP library such as
Apple's Natural Language Framework into the app. We will also need to design and
implement the UI for the chatbot, which could include a UITableView to display
the conversation and a custom input view that allows the user to enter text and
send messages to the chatbot.

To train the NLP model, we will need to provide it with a dataset of example
phrases and their corresponding intents. We can start with a small dataset of
common phrases and gradually add more as we refine the model.

To handle user input and display the chatbot's responses, we can use a
combination of delegation and data source methods in the view controller. When
the user enters text and taps send, the input text will be sent to the NLP model
for processing. Once the intent of the message has been determined, we can use a
switch statement to determine the appropriate response from the chatbot.

Differences from Middle 2:

At the Middle 3 level, the developer should have a deeper understanding of NLP
and be able to integrate it into the app. They should also have experience with
training NLP models and be able to create a dataset of example phrases and
intents. In addition, they should be able to design and implement complex UI
features such as a chatbot interface with conversation-like formatting.
