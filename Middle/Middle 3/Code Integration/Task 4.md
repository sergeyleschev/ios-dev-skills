# Task 4

Task: You are working on a team developing a new iOS app. Your task is to
integrate a new library into the project using CocoaPods. The library is called
"Alamofire" and you need to make sure that it is installed and configured
correctly.

Solution:

1. Open Terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Install CocoaPods if you haven't already by running
   **`sudo gem install cocoapods`**.
3. Run **`pod init`** to create a new Podfile.
4. Open the Podfile in a text editor.
5. Add the following lines to the Podfile:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'YourAppName' do
  pod 'Alamofire', '~> 5.0'
end
```

6. Save the Podfile and run **`pod install`**.
7. Close Xcode and open the newly created workspace file.
8. Import the Alamofire library in any file you need to use it in by adding
   **`import Alamofire`** at the top.
9. Build and run the app to ensure that the library has been integrated
   successfully.

Differences indicating development to Middle 3: In this task, the developer is
expected to integrate a third-party library using CocoaPods, which requires a
good understanding of how CocoaPods works and how to configure it correctly.
Additionally, the use of **`use_frameworks!`** in the Podfile and
**`import Alamofire`** in the code demonstrate knowledge of how to work with
external frameworks and libraries. Finally, the task requires the developer to
be able to identify any issues that may arise during the installation and
configuration process and to troubleshoot them effectively.
